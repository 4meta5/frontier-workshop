# Frontier Workshop

[Substrate](https://substrate.dev) is an extensible blockchain development framework. [Frontier](https://github.com/paritytech/frontier) is a set of modules to build an Ethereum-compatible blockchain with Substrate. [Moonbeam](https://moonbeam.network) is a Polkadot parachain built with Substrate and Frontier.

This tutorial explains the concepts and demonstrates the steps necessary to build an Ethereum-compatible chain using Frontier. We make this tutorial public in the hopes that it will be useful, but the software in question is cutting edge and actively being developed. Expect things to break sometimes.

## Maintenance and Development

This tutorial is written with ‚ù§ by the Moonbeam team, and made public in hopes that it will be useful.

The software being described here changes quickly and it is likely that the tutorial will go stale and need routine maintenance from time to time. The Moonbeam team makes no commitment to do that maintenance, but welcomes external contributions.

If you do encounter issues when following this tutorial, please [file a bug](https://github.com/JoshOrndorff/frontier-workshop/issues/new) on github.
